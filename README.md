#   Eco-Market (Waste-Based NFT)

## Overview
Eco-Market is designed to tokenize waste generation and create Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing specific amounts and types of waste. It leverages the ZetaChain network for cross-chain compatibility.

## Core Functionalities

### NFT Minting: 
Creates NFTs based on verified waste data, including type and quantity.

### Metadata Storage:
 Stores relevant information about each NFT, such as waste type, amount, and originating chain.

### Cross-Chain Compatibility: 
Facilitates NFT creation and management across different blockchains through ZetaChain.

### NFT Burning:
 Allows users to burn their NFTs and withdraw associated value.

 ## How It Works

 ### Waste Verification: 
 (To be implemented) The contract integrates with a waste verification system to ensure accurate and reliable waste data.
### NFT Minting:
 Once waste is verified, an NFT is minted, representing the verified waste quantity and type. The NFT is assigned a unique ID and metadata is stored.
### Cross-Chain Interaction:
 The contract utilizes ZetaChain's capabilities to enable cross-chain NFT minting and management.
### NFT Burning:
 Users can burn their NFTs, triggering the withdrawal of associated value back to the original chain.

 ## Potential Use Cases

### Waste Management Incentives:
 Reward users for recycling and waste reduction through NFT-based incentives.
### Supply Chain Transparency:
 Track the lifecycle of waste products through NFT-based provenance.
### Carbon Offset Markets: 
Facilitate the trading of carbon credits represented as NFTs.

## Limitations
### Requires integration with a waste verification system.
### NFT metadata storage is basic and can be enhanced.
### Additional features like NFT trading and marketplace integration are needed for full functionality.
